## Development environment
- Bash prompt
- Vim IDE

## Plan
> One script to rule them all.
Having to frequently switch between environments, it is cumbersome to setup 
the development environment manually, or through gists.

Ideally, using a single curl & sh to setup everything immediately. 

Download installer script: 
    curl link to ~/.ssh/setup_devenv.sh | sh setup_devenv.sh

- download bash_promp to ~/.bash_prompt and source it
- download vimrc and and install it
